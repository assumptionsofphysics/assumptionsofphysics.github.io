There is a sense among many physicists that the most important task in understanding nature is to figure out what are the rules that govern the most fundamental constituents. If we knew that, everything would be clear. This cannot be further from the truth.

First of all, as a colleague that works on solid state physics (i.e. the part of physics that studies how properties of materials are connected to their atomic structure), his field would not exist if that was true. That is, we in principle have already all the rules that govern atomic and molecular interactions. Yet, understanding how billions of billions of atoms work together is vastly more complicated.

Try to argue that best explanation needs to be articulated at the right level. The right level is where explanation decouples from "irrelevant details". No real fundamental level in physics is as well: things recombine (contextuality) so no real fundamental level for everything.

Empirical vs forensic evidence
