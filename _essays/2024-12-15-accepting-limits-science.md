I think there is somewhat of a mental disconnect between what physics, or science more generally, can tell us about the universe and what people want it to be able to tell us. From philosophers who want to reach metaphysical conclusions about the nature of reality, to physicists who want to give an account of space and time at a fundamental level. Since mere experimentation will not be able to provide those answers, some people "push the boundaries of science," meaning they try to apply it beyond its capabilities. This muddles the waters: if science can talk about infinite worlds that are not experimentally accessible, why shouldn't it talk about a creator that directs evolution? Since I don't like my peas and my carrots to touch, let's talk about what science is, and what it can and cannot do.

Let us first get one thing straight: not all facts are scientific facts. "Integrals are anti-derivatives" is a fact but not a scientific fact. It is a provable statement, not an experimentally testable statement. "Napoleon lost at Waterloo" is a fact, but it is not a scientific fact. Napoleon is a one-of-a-kind, irreproducible sample. "x86 processors are little-endian" is a fact, but it is not a scientific fact. It is just the technical decision made in that architecture. Math, history, engineering, music â€” many important disciplines are not science, and it would be absurd to treat them otherwise. You don't conduct an experiment to see whether integrals are anti-derivatives, whether Napoleon lost at Waterloo, or whether x86 processors are little-endian. You write a proof, you consult trusted sources, or you read a manual. Somehow, "not being scientific" has become an insult. It is not.

Science is about what can be tested experimentally in a reproducible way. Physics in particular is about simple systems that can be studied and described independently from the rest. For example, whenever we act on an object with a constant force, it will exhibit a constant acceleration in the same direction; at a given temperature, increasing the pressure of a gas will decrease its volume, and so on. This allows us to build a body of knowledge about the world that anyone can be certain about because anyone can (in principle) test it for themselves. However, this comes with a limitation: the explanation is the experimental data. Even when we construct mechanistic explanations (e.g. heat is the chaotic vibration of molecules, many peculiar properties of water are due to its hydrogen bonds), which explain higher constructs in terms of more fundamental ones, the latter have to be taken as-is. Why are there electrons? Because we see them experimentally.

This is something that is also true for math or any other system of thought: the primitives are primitives; they cannot be explained. If one tries to explain them, they will end up with another set of primitives. Personally, I have never had problems accepting these types of limitations. The game is simply to find a good set of starting points. They should be clear, intuitive, and meaningful. They should be powerful, in the sense that a lot can be derived from little. They should decouple well from the problem at hand. That is as much as we can ask. Hence, the Assumptions of Physics project.

However, I am finding that quite a few people do not seem satisfied with this. They want to know more. Why are there these particular particles with these particular masses? Why is there a universe? Why are there four forces? Ultimately, physics cannot answer any of these questions without opening others. "All forces are really one force!" "But why is there only one force?" When I point this out, sometimes I get an accusing question: how could I find it satisfying?

I do not have to find it satisfying: it is what it is. Trying to use science for these more open-ended questions only gives empty answers, like "the vacuum is unstable and it will generate universes." This is just stringing together some scientific-sounding jargon: you cannot possibly know that, and you cannot test it. It's not science. Science is a really good hammer, but not everything is a nail. We have better tools for truly fundamental questions about existence and purpose: philosophy and religion. Learn how to use them.
