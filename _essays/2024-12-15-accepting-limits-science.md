While talking to other people about the foundations of physics, I have always been at odds, somewhat surprised, with a certain attitude that tries to use physics to reach conclusions that are beyond its capabilities. Recently, while stating the limitations of scientific explanations, I was asked how I could be satisfied by those limitations. Since I didn't have a response ready, I'll prepare one here.

First of all, given the experimental nature of science, the only thing it can do is say that whenever we prepare or observe a set of conditions, we are also going to observe another set of conditions. For example, whenever we act on an object with a constant force, it will exhibit a constant acceleration in the same direction; at a given temperature, increasing the pressure of a gas will decrease its volume and so on. Even when we construct mechanistic explanations (e.g. heat is the chaotic vibration of molecules, many peculiar properties of water are due to its hydrogen bonds) which explain higher constructs in terms of more fundamental ones, the latter have to be taken as is. The final level will be given in terms of object (e.g. quantum fields) and some unexplained relationships: whenever these objects are prepared in some way, they will evolve in a given way. There is no further explanation. Things are like that because we tested them to be like that.

This is something that is also true for math or any other system of thought: the primitives are primitives; they cannot be explained. If one tries to explain the axiom, he will end up with another set of axioms. Peronally, I never had problems accepting these types of limitations. My conclusion is that we simply have to find a good set of starting points, meaning that they are clear, intuitive and meaningful. That are powerful, in the sense that a lot can be derived from little. They should decouple well the problem at hand. That is as much as we can ask. Hense, the Assumptions of Physics project.

However, I am finding that quite a few people do not seem satisfied with this. They want to know more. Why is there a universe? Why are quantum measurements non-deterministic? Why are there four forces? Ultimately, physics cannot answer these questions. Even if we could show that the four forces are really different manifestations of a single one, we would still have to answer "why is there one force?". Pointing this out is, understably, not satisfactory. How could I be satisfied?

First of all, the alternative is worse. Coming up with scientific sounding answers (e.g. "the vacuum is unstable and it will generate universes" or "we live in one of many parallel universes") just muddles the waters. It makes it seem that stringing together some jargon on top of some math is enough to do science. It pushes us away from empirical evidence, which is the real foundation of physics. 

At the end of the day,
