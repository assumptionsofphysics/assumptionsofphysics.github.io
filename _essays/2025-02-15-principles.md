Last week I attended the Midwest Philosophy of Physics Meeting, and Don Howard from the University of Notre Dame gave a historical presentation on Eistein's distiction between principle and constructive theories. The general idea is that constructive a theory is defined by postulating the existence of some entities and their behavior. For example, it will say that there are particles that have charge, and that they interact accordig to some set of equations. A principle theory, instead, starts with statements that are experimentally well-founded and builds from there. The principle of relativity, the invariance of the speed of light and the equivalence principle (between gravitational and apparent forces) are examples of such principle. In Einstein's mind, ultimately all physical theories are constructive theories, but the principle theory play a more fundamental role as they are needed to guide the constructive theory. If we adopt that view, it should be evident that we are not in a good position to solve something like quantum gravity: we have no clear principles to guide us.

The key issue is that we are trying to construct a theory for a regime we have no direct experience of. So, how are going to know whether those evidential principles are going to apply in those cases? Moreover, not all principles we have are well formulated in terms of physical ideas. For example, all current physical theories work in a Lagrangian framework, where it is assumed that the correct way to formulate a theory is through the principle of stationary action. How can we know whether this will still apply or not? In our Reverse Physics approach we show that, at least in classical particle mechanics, the principle of least action is derived from the assumption of determinism and reversibility and the independence of all degrees of freedom. Maybe it is not true that all the information needed for a deterministic and reversible description is physically accessible. Maybe it is not true that degrees of freedom are completely independent. In this case, the principle of least action would not apply and it would need to be substituted with something else. Unfortunately, we have found very few people within physics interested in exploring these ideas.

So, if evidential principles are not a good guide, what could we use? In our project, we have found that constitutive principle have a lot more power than one may expect. A constitutive principle is a statement that one has to take to be true not because of experimental evidence, but because it is something that is needed to define and proceed with the task at hand. For example, "science is about experimental evidence" is a constitutive principle. We do not find that science is about experimentation... experimentally. It is how we distinguish science from other disciplines. Now, this seems a very mild assertion, but it has actually very powerful. It means that science does not deal with mere statements, but with statements that are associated with a test. While a statement can simply be true or false, a test my succeed, fail or may not terminate. Not all staments, then, are experimentally verifiable. For example, right now we believe there are six quarks. Technically, we know there are "at least" six quarks. We cannot exclude whether there are more. However, we can exclude that there are five. The logic of these statements, then, is slightly different than the logic of standard statements. It turns out that, if one studies this logic, he can recover the notion of topologies and sigma algebras, which are fundamental mathematical structures at the foundations of all other mathematical structures we use in physics. So the fact that "science is about experimental evidence" tells us that a set of physically distinguishable cases is a $$\mathsf{T}_0$$ second countable topological space. The constitutive principle constrains the math.

Another constitutive principle is that "physical laws are reproducibly testable." That is, physical laws are not about a paricular instance at a particular time, but are about setup that can be replicated over and over. Physical laws, then, are really about collection of results: whenever I do this, I get that. Moreover, reproducibility means we can always test the laws "one more time," which implies that these collections are infinite. In other word, the mere idea of a physical law implies the notion of a statistical ensemble. These statistical ensemble must be experimentally well defined (i.e. points in a $$\mathsf{T}_0$$ second countable topological space), allow for statistical mixture (i.e. form a convex space) and must have an entropy that represents the variability of the preparation within the ensemble. It turns out that these requirements, by themselves, are enough to recover vector spaces, a generalization of probability measures, geometrical structure... all of these are implied simply by saying that "physical laws are reproducibly testable," without mentions of whether we have classical mechanics or quantum mechanics.

Focusing on constitutive principles, then, allows us to reach a different type of unification: a general mathematical framework for scientific theories that must apply equally to all of them. It allows us to generalize results and differentiate what "happens to be true" within a set of theories from what "must be true" in all physical theories. If our reasoning is correct, rejecting the results means rejecting that "science is about experimental evidence" or that "physical laws are reproducibly testable." It is not rejecting the interpretation of certain class of experimental data collected in some circumstances, which should always be open to debate. It is rejecting the very nature of science and physics. Constitutive principle, then, are a much sturdier foundations for both the physics we have and the one yet to be discovered.
