Find if there are more mathematically interesting and precise ways to
express the idea of invariant measures.

*Mathematical problem.* In our derivation of classical mechanics, we recover
symplectic spaces by requiring that the measure needed to quantify the number
of states in a region must be coordinate invariant. That is, we need to be able
to change coordinates while keeping the measure invariant. This leads to the need
of a conjugate quantity such that $$dq \wedge dp = dq' \wedge dp'$$. The question is whether we can formalize this requirement in a more abstract way,
since other theories (e.g. quantum mechanics) must have a similar requirements (e.g.
for differentiable manifolds, there is the idea of [generalized complex structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_complex_structure)).

One way to approach the problem is to see what properties measures possess on the complex plane.
This may be related to understanding why integration on the complex plane is
more powerful than on the real line. Trying to justify those properties from the physics may
lead to new ideas.

*Physical significance.* The requirement of coordinate invariant measure
stems from the principle of relativity and the idea that nature must
account for preservation of number of states during deterministic and
reversible evolution without specific reference to reference frames.

Here we want to find the most minimal and general mathematical argument to
that effect.
