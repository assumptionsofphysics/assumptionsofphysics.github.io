A recurrent idea in our project is that ensembles are the prime physical objects
while pure states are the abstraction. The goal, then, is to find the minimum set of
axioms for that area always justified for statistical ensembles. Classical mechanics
and quantum mechanics should be the specialization of such spaces.
Current findings are summed up [here](https://latexonline.cc/compile?git=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fassumptionsofphysics%2Fassumptionsofphysics&target=Notes/2023-GeneralizedEnsembleSpaces/GeneralizedEnsembleSpaces.tex&command=pdflatex)

*Mathematical problem.* We found appropriate axioms for convex spaces,
which an ensemble space can be shown to satisfy. The idea is that one can
alwayre create affine combinations $$\sum_i p_i x_i$$  of ensembles $$p_i$$,
as long as $$\sum_i a_i = 1$$. Whether ensemble spaces always embed into
a vector space is unclear.

Classical discrete spaces correspond to symplexes. Classical continuum spaces
correspond to the space of differentiable function defined over a symplectic manifold,
which also integrate to one. Quantum spaces correspond to the space of positive
semi-definite Hermitian operators with trace one.

We are still looking for the appriate axioms for entropy, for subspaces and
the proper characterization of the different cases in terms of these objects.

*Physical significance.* The convex combinations represent the statistical
mixtures. The focus on ensembles as basic objects is explained by the
reproducibility of physical laws. A law, in fact, never applies to a single
case, but estabilish a ``whenever X, we have Y'' relationship. Therefore
the objects must be repeatable procedure of measurements and preparation.
This means that X and Y must be, conceptually, ensembles.
