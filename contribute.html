            <p>If you share our goal of reformulating of physics from well founded
            principles and assumptions, here are a few things you can do to further
            our goal.</p>
            <h3>Promote the project</h3>
            <p>This is probably the easiest and most helpful way you can help.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Like/share/promote the material we publish through the YouTube channel and Facebook page, particularly on platforms where we are not active</li>
                <li>Ask your favorite scientific magazine/podcast/YouTube channel/... to invite us and/or speak about the project</li>
                <li>If you are a university student, propose one of our papers at your reading groups or propose us for a seminar/colloquium talk at your physics/math/philosophy/engineering department</li>
                <li>If you are a researcher and want to cite our project, please cite the book.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Contribute to the project</h3>
            <p>Before investing too much time, contact us to coordinate and avoid
            multiple people working on the same thing.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Grab the latest version of the book or other material and report typos/math errors/...</li>
                <li>Help us improve book figures and layout (Latex), website (HTML, Bootstrap, Jekyll), our social media presence, ...</li>
                <li>If you have a background in math/science/engineering/philosophy of science, consider contributing a bare minimum</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Contribute to the research</h3>
            <p>As the topic is highly specialized, this type of contribution
            is realistic only if it has a connection to your active research or field of study.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Make yourself available as a consultant, which means provide insight into specific academic fields and their literature</li>
                <li>Go through the blueprint papers to review the status of active areas of inquiry</li>
                <li>Help us determine conferences and communities that may be interested in the project</li>
                <li>Propose a joint paper in a field in which you have a publication track record</li>
            </ul>
