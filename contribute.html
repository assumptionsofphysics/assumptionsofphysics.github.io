            <p>If you share our goal of reformulating of physics from well founded
            principles and assumptions, here are a few things you can do to further
            our goal.</p>
            <h3>Promote the project</h3>
            <p>This is probably the easiest and most helpful way you can help.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Like/share/promote the material we publish on YouTube/LinkedIn/Facebook, particularly on platforms where we are not active</li>
                <li>Ask your favorite scientific magazine/podcast/YouTube channel/... to invite us and/or speak about the project</li>
                <li>If you are a university student, propose one of our papers at your reading groups or propose us for a seminar/colloquium talk at your physics/math/philosophy/engineering department</li>
                <li>If you are a researcher and want to cite our project, please cite the book.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Contribute to the project</h3>
            <p>Not all contributions require advanced expertise in the research areas.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Grab the latest version of the book or other material and report typos/math errors/...</li>
                <li>Help us improve book figures and layout (Latex), website (HTML, Bootstrap, Jekyll), our social media presence, ...</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Contribute to the research</h3>
            <p>As the topic is highly specialized, this type of contribution is realistic only if it has a connection to your active research or field of study.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Follow our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@AssumptionsofPhysicsResearch">research channel</a></li>
                <li>If you are an expert in a related field, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSenO_qyRxj9afTi0BfbIkPkGNnfTycc_9UDKgXUQ_AoBQCUIg/viewform?usp=dialog"></a>make yourself available as a consultant</a>, which means providing knowledge in its literature and potentially useful insights</li>
                <li>If you are student interested in learning and contributing, please refer to the <a href="https://youtu.be/3Cb4DNUYmcg">latest video overview</a> and the latest videos from our <a href="presentations/2024SummerSchool.html">summer school</a> to get oriented in possible research topics</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you contact us, please do mention you read this page and which of the above points have you followed.</p>
