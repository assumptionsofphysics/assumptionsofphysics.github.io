        <p>Thank you for considering donating to our project. Standard funding opportunities do not cover the type of interdisciplinary research we believe is necessary to advance the foundations of physics, therefore we appreciate any contribution.</p>
        <p>We are currently working the university to set a more stable way to process the donations.</p>
        <!--<p>At this point, the only way the university is allowing us to receive donations is through the Physics Strategic Fund, which unfortunately sometimes misdirects the donation. You can donate through <a href="https://giving.umich.edu/basket/fund/331942/category/program-support,science-technology-engineering-and-math_science,science-technology-engineering-and-math_natural-sciences,college-of-literature,-science,-and-the-arts_physics?utm_source=LSA&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=SEG_PME_LSA_FY25_Mar_Assumptions_of_Physics&">this link</a> and then <a href="mailto:info@assumptionsofphysics.org">TELL US</a> your name and the amount for the donation so that we can make sure the donation goes to the project. If you find this confusing, consider writing to <a href="mailto:umgift@umich.edu">this address</a> stating it would be better for Assumptions of Physics to have its own code for donations, which they refused to do. If enough of you complain, it is likely that they'll listen to you more than us.</p>-->
        <p>We are also in the process of understanding how to set up our own nonprofit foundation in Michigan (United States), and actively looking for help in that area.</p>
