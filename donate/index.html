        <p>Thank you for considering donating to our program. Standard funding opportunities do not cover the type of interdisciplinary research we believe is necessary to advance the foundations of physics, therefore we appreciate any contribution.</p>
        <p>Donations will cover some of the activities of the program, which include research travel, conferences, publication costs, equipment (hardware and software) and other expenses.</p>
