        <p>Thank you for considering donating to our program. Standard funding opportunities do not cover the type of interdisciplinary research we believe is necessary to advance the foundations of physics, therefore we appreciate any contribution.</p>
        <p>You can donate through the <a href="https://myumi.ch/G2kpm">university through the generic Physics Strategic Fund</a>. Please, also <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-dKnq86PJdrlLLGpzd2C5XvOdF9lWUElf3Q-db7u7OVZYtg/viewform?usp=header">fill in this form</a> with your name and the amount for the donation so that we can make sure the donation goes to our program.</p>
        <p>We are also in the process of setting up different ways to donate to the Assumptions of Physics Foundation directly. For more information, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@assumptionsofphysics.org">info@assumptionsofphysics.org</a></p>
        <p>- Gabriele</p>
