        <p>Thank you for considering donating to our project. Standard funding opportunities do not cover the type of interdisciplinary research we believe is necessary to advance the foundations of physics, therefore we appreciate any contribution.</p>
        <p>The only way the university is allowing us to receive donations is through the generic Physics Strategic Fund, so it is important that you tell us directly as well. You can donate through <a href="https://myumi.ch/G2kpm">this link</a> and then <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd-dKnq86PJdrlLLGpzd2C5XvOdF9lWUElf3Q-db7u7OVZYtg/viewform?usp=header">fill in this form</a> with your name and the amount for the donation so that we can make sure the donation goes to the project.</p>
        <p>- Gabriele</p>
