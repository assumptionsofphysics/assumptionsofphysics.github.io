        <p>Thank you for consider donating to our project. Standard funding opportunities do not cover the type of interdisciplinary research we believe is necessary to advance the foundations of physics, therefore we appreciate any contribution.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, after more than seven months of trying to setup a donation box through our institution, we still do not have a reliable way for you to donate. If you could write to <a href="mailto:umgift@umich.edu">this address</a> asking for instruction on how to donate to the Assumptions of Physics project, there is a chance that they would pay more attention to us. This page is essentially a placeholder until that situation is resolved.</p>
        <p>We are also in the process of understanding how to setup our own charitable foundation Michigan (United States), and actively looking for help in that area.</p>
        <p>- Gabriele</p>
