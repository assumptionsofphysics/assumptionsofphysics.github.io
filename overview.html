                            wave function (i.e. a vector in a Hilbert space)? Could we have had different laws?</p>
                        <p class="lead text-center">In this project we explore these questions by
                            identifying a handful of physical principles from which the basic laws can be rigorously derived.
                            The aim is to fully clarify under what physical assumptions each physical theory is valid,
                            providing a clear understanding of their foundation that requires no interpretation because
                            the physical meaning is made precise right from the start. Uncovering hidden assumptions
                            forces us to understand their limitations, possibly leading to new insights and ideas.</p>

                            <p>There has always been an effort to formalize a physical theory from a small set
                                of well defined physics principles or laws. Newtonian mechanics, special relativity and thermodynamics,
                                for example, follow that pattern. Unfortunately, this practice has stopped in modern times.
                                Lagrangian mechanics and Quantum mechanics, for example, simply
                                posit the mathematical structure without a clear justification as to what is physically described
                                and why those rules exist. Physics is recovered at a later stage, by "interpreting" the results
                                of the mathematical theory.</p>
                            <p>In this project we want to revert back to that original spirit and put the physics at the center of our physical theories.
                                We want to identify those physical starting points, our physical assumptions, and then derive
                                the mathematical framework as a necessary consequence. By proceeding in this fashion, it is
                                always clear under what conditions a particular theory can be assumed to be valid, it is clear
                                what mathematical structure are physically meaningful and what are just artifacts introduced
                                by mathematicians to make calculations or proofs easier to develop. It also allows us to think
                                more deeply about our starting points, leading to new insights and possible new approaches.</p>

                            <p>The foundations of mathematics settled during the beginning of the 20th century. Work by
                                Cantor, Russel, Zermelo, Fraenkel, Godel and many others re-organized the whole discipline
                                on top of logic and set theory. During that period physics was tackling new ideas in
                                both theory and experiment, which lead to general relativity and quantum mechanics, and 
                                never really took that step at fully identifying the formal foundations of its discipline.</p>
                            <p> In this project we establish a general mathematical theory for experimental science,
                                which aims to axiomatize the underpinning of all scientific disciplines in the same way
                                that logic and axiomatic set theory establishes the underpinning of all modern math.
                                The core concept is the idea of an experimentally verifiable statement: an assertion that,
                                if true, can be verified to be so in a finite amount of time. We establish the logic of
                                these objects and we see how they lead to topologies and sigma-algebras. A physical theory,
                                then, is simply a collection of verifiable statement with a well defined semantic relationship
                                between them.</p>
                            <p> Uncovering the assumptions of physics means understanding how a physical assumption
                                is formally captured by the semantic relationship between statements, and how those relationships
                                necessarily lead to a given mathematical structure.</p>

                            <p>Over the last century, there has been an increasing interest within philosophy of
                                science on the foundations of the physical theories. Particularly in quantum mechanics,
                                the effort is to better characterize the mathematical structure describing the theory
                                in terms of "real" ontological entities. The main issue here is that the same mathematical
                                equation can be used to describe different physical systems (e.g. linear systems are used
                                in electronics, thermodynamics, biology, etc...) and the same physical system can be
                                described by different mathematical structures (e.g. a massive point particle can be modeled
                                by a point in a cotangent bundle or by a point in a tangent bundle).</p>
                            <p>In this project we develop the mathematical structures of science starting by clearly defining the physical
                                objects we are studying, with particular attention to the philosophical aspects that
                                arise with those definitions. As we do this from the very beginning, we are forced
                                to clarify many aspects that are usually "swept under the rug". As everything else is
                                built on top these definitions, the mathematical structures have one clear meaning and 
                                there are no issue of interpretation. This provides a better framework to understand
                                what science is, what the laws of physics are and what they can or cannot be describing.</p>

                                        ranges of initial states have to map linearly to ranges of initial conditions (symplectic form induces a metric). This constrains the possible relationships between velocities and
                                        momentum and limits the system to massive particles moving under forces described by scalar or vector potentials.</td>
